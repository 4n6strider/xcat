# Introduction

xcat is an advanced tool for exploiting XPath injection vulnerabilities, featuring a comprehensive 
set of features to read the entire file being queried as well as other files on the filesystem, 
environment variables and directories.

## Quickstart

The easiest way to get started is to install the tool via pip:

`pip install xcat`

You can then use the `xcat` command to launch attacks. 
See [commands](commands.md) for a full reference.
